								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>
									I am currently a student studying Computer Science at the University of Washington in Seattle.
									I'll be graduating in June of 2022! Outside of classes I love playing soccer, going hiking, reading,
									listening to music, and spending time with family and friends. I grew up in Redmond, Washington with my parents and younger brother. 
									I attended Redmond Middle School and Tesla STEM High School while conitnuing to engage in both soccer and basketball. 
									I think engaging in sports influenced a lot of who I am today.
								</p>
								<h2>Education</h2>
								<p>
									For the most part, I think my education has been nothing too out of the ordinary. I attended public elementary and middle school. 
									I took the school bus almost every day of school. I don't have too many memories ridng the bus except for playing Temple Run on 
									a friend's phone. I also had a bus driver who would ocassionaly play the harmonica and ask the same riddle every year: "What kind of 
									bear has no teeth?" </b> The answer is "a gummy bear" by the way.
								</p>
								<p>
									High school is where I think my education differed from some. I attended Nikola Tesla STEM High School (TSHS) which was "choice school." 
									To get in, I submitted an application expressing my interest in attending a high school focussed on STEM subjects. Entry was lottery 
									based so I feel pretty lucky. While in high school, I took many STEM classes such as envrionmental science, physics, calculus, statistics, 
									and so on. Many of them where AP level. I think the most unique class I took was Envrionmental Engineering and Sustainable Design (EESD). 
									I also had to take non-STEM classes as well though such as history, english, and health.
								</p>
								<p>
									My high school was a public school but because 
									it was a "choice school, " we had no sports teams or even a mascot. My classmates and I would joke around that our mascot should be "The 
									Calculators" or "The Pigeons". We didn't have sports teams, so the only competitions affiliated with the school were academic. We were 
									encourgaed to join competition clubs such as Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), Technology Student Association (TSA), Health Occupations 
									Students of America - Future Health Professionals (HOSA), and more. We also were encouraged to attend engineering compeitions and science fairs. 
									I participated in the science fairs and other engineering competitions like "Imagine Tomorrow" and did well. The club I participated in the most 
									was actually HOSA though. I competed in events such as Biomedical Debate, Nutrition, Pathophysiology, Epidemiology, etc.. I don't remember much 
									to be honest. I do remeber doing well in the Epidemiology event. I won first place at the state conference and placed 8th at the international conference. 
									The most memorable part of being part of HOSA were the conferences. Though HOSA, I visited Anaheim, Nashville, and Orlando. High school really feels like 
									blur right now actually. To sum it up in a couple of words, high school was: class, clubs, academic competitions, sports. Oh yea, and I almost forgot, 
									my friend and I decided to start a chess club for our high school. Neither of us were super good at chess but we thought it was fun.

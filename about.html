								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>
									I am currently a student studying Computer Science at the University of Washington in Seattle.
									I'll be graduating in June of 2022! Outside of classes I love playing soccer, going hiking, reading,
									listening to music, and spending time with family and friends. I grew up in Redmond, Washington with my parents and younger brother. 
									I attended Redmond Middle School and Tesla STEM High School while conitnuing to engage in both soccer and basketball. 
									I think engaging in sports influenced a lot of who I am today.
								</p>
								<h2>Education</h2>
								<p>
									For the most part, I think my education has been nothing too out of the ordinary. I attended public elementary and middle school. 
									I took the school bus almost every day of school. I don't have too many memories ridng the bus except for playing Temple Run on 
									a friend's phone. I also had a bus driver who would ocassionaly play the harmonica and ask the same riddle every year: "What kind of 
									bear has no teeth?" </b> The answer is "a gummy bear" by the way.
								</p>
								<p>
									High school is where I think my education differed from some. I attended Nikola Tesla STEM High School (TSHS) which was "choice school." 
									To get in, I submitted an application expressing my interest in attending a high school focussed on STEM subjects. Entry was lottery 
									based so I feel pretty lucky. While in high school, I took many STEM classes such as envrionmental science, physics, calculus, statistics, 
									and so on. Many of them where AP level. I think the most unique class I took was Envrionmental Engineering and Sustainable Design (EESD). 
									I had to take non-STEM classes as well though such as history, english, and health.
								</p>
								<p>
									My high school was a public school but because 
									it was a "choice school, " we had no sports teams or even a mascot. My classmates and I would joke around that our mascot should be "The 
									Calculators" or "The Pigeons". We didn't have sports teams, so the only competitions affiliated with the school were academic. We were 
									encourgaed to join competition clubs such as Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), Technology Student Association (TSA), Health Occupations 
									Students of America - Future Health Professionals (HOSA), and more. We also were encouraged to attend engineering compeitions and science fairs. 
									I participated in the science fairs and other engineering competitions like "Imagine Tomorrow" and did well. The club I participated in the most 
									was actually HOSA though. I competed in events such as Biomedical Debate, Nutrition, Pathophysiology, Epidemiology, etc.. I don't remember much 
									to be honest. I do remeber doing well in the Epidemiology event. I won first place at the state conference and placed 8th at the international conference. 
									The most memorable part of being part of HOSA were the conferences. Though HOSA, I visited Anaheim, Nashville, and Orlando. High school really feels like a 
									blur right now actually. To sum it up in a couple of words, high school was: class, clubs, academic competitions, sports. Oh yea, and I almost forgot, 
									my friend and I decided to start a chess club for our high school. Neither of us were super good at chess but we thought it was fun.
								</p>
								<h2>College</h2>
								<p>
									I ended up attended the University of Washington in Seattle where I am currently a senior now. When I applied, I had applied directly into the Computer Science 
									program and I was fortunate enough to be admitted. I was, and still am, very grateful that I didn't have to worry about applying to a major once college started. 
									From what I heard, the process is extremely stressful. </b></b> So far at the UW, I gotten involved in some activities outside of class. I've been playing on the 
									Women's Club Soccer Team since my freshman year and it has been one of the best experiences of college so far. I was also a member of the UW Formula Motorsports 
									Firmware team for just over year before trying out research in the CSE Sensor Systems Labs for 6 months. I've also had some involvement in the Society of Women Engineers 
									as well as some mentorship programs. I'm really glad I am at UW. It was definitely a good decision to come here. 
								</p>

								<h2>Sports</h2>
								<p>
									Soccer and basketball have played a large role in my life. I started both sports at a young age at the recreational level. When I was eligible, I started playing more 
									competitively in a soccer club called Crossfire, and also AAU basketball for various clubs like EBC and FOH. During high school, I played 4 years on the Varsity team 
									of both sports. The high school I went to didn't have sports so I played for the school I would have gone to - Redmond High School. Playing sports taught me so much 
									and have helped define who I am today. I work hard and I collaborate well with others. I also have good time management and organizational skills as I had to balance 
									sports and school. I also learned leadership skills through leading by example and also as a team captain. Playing sports has been a constant in my life and I wouldn't 
									have it any other way. 
								</p>
								<h2>Career</h2>
								<p>
									After graduating college I will work as a software engineer in Seattle. I am interested in backend work right now but I look forward to exploring and finding my passion within 
									the field. I really like understanding how things work and solving problems. A career in software engineering will be fun and rewarding for me I think.
								</p>
								<h2>Misc</h2>
								<p>
									Other things about me... I love hiking. I love nature and I love good views. One of the reasons I love Seattle is because of the hikes near by - alpine lakes, waterfalls, lush 
									green forests, fresh air, and more. It's amazing and it makes me not want to ever leave the PNW. If I do leave, I think I'll eventaully come back. I also like reading books. Some 
									of my favorite books include "Stuff Matters" by Mark Miodownik, which dives into the science behind everyday materials, and  "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, which talks about habit 
									building and understanding our own behaviors. I also love listening to music. I love indie alternative, indie rock, some soft pop, and chill music in general. Honestly I'm just out 
									here trying to live my life and be happy.

								<h2>Study Abroad</h2>
								<p>
									During the "early fall" quarter of 2019 I went on a short study abroad to China. In addition to taking Chinese language courses, 
									at Sichuan University, my study abroad group went sight-seeing to many places including the Chengdu Panda Base and Downtown Shanghai. 
									We also did things like ride cable cars, go on a boat, ride the train, eat spicy sichuan hot pot, and so much more.
